Current BD: AdventureWorksLT (lab2)

Steps to request lab checking:
1. Work with MS SQL Management Studio (create queries, verify that works)
2. Create branch with name "<LastName>_<Lab#>" and checkout. Do not work in "master" branch
3. Create queries file .sql in "Queries" folder
4. If you have Python 3.* installed, you can verify execution by run "run_validation.py"
5. If you believe you finished - commit your changes and push it to the remote.
6. On the remote (github.com/Bidonus/BD_IVT_17_3/branches) you can verify that your branch was ran on the CI.
   If you see green arrow - everything good. If red cross - something wrong.
7. To improve your git skills, i recommend to make pull request (doesnt matter: by git command or in github).
   It will give you an experience of working with code review.
